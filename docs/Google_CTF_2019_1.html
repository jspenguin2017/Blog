<p>A new year, a
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/google-ctf-2019-is-here.html">new Google CTF</a>.
And with it, comes new beginners quests. Let's get started!</p>
<h2 id="enterspacetimecoordinates">Enter Space-Time Coordinates</h2>
<p>The attachment contains two files: a text log file and a binary. The log file
doesn't contain the flag but what about the binary? Knowing that flags should
start with <code>CTF</code>, it's pretty easy to extract the flag from the binary using
the <code>strings</code> utility from <code>binutils</code> package:</p>
<pre><code>$ strings rand2 | grep CTF
Arrived at the flag. Congrats, your flag is: CTF{welcome_to_googlectf}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="ad">Ad</h2>
<p>This quest links to a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzFuwljOj8Y">YouTube video</a> which supposedly
contains a flag. The video is a promotional video for Google CTF 2019 event,
and at around <code>0:17</code>, a flag is shown on the screen for one frame. Note that
<code>,</code> and <code>.</code> keys can be used to rewind or forward frame by frame.</p>
<p>The flag is <code>CTF{9e796ca74932912c216a1cd00c25c84fae00e139}</code>.</p>
<h2 id="satellite">Satellite</h2>
<p>Apparently the last quest is optional, in fact, it doesn't even show up on the
map! Anyway, let's get back on track.</p>
<p>The attachment for this quest is quite large, almost 6 MiB! It contains a PDF
file and a binary, both are around 3 MiB. Since the binary is so large, it is
probably not written in native code. Examining the strings in the binary
further confirms that theory, specifically, the binary is probably written in
the Go programming language.</p>
<p>I spent quite some time trying to decompile and debug the binary, with limited
success. The only significant discovery I made is that the binary uses the
<code>net</code> package, indicating it may connect to remote servers. Reading the PDF
document again, I noticed that it mentions something about the security of
connection. I started Wireshark but the binary isn't making any connections.
I then tried to look for a domain-like string using <code>strings</code> and <code>grep</code>, and I
found <code>satellite.ctfcompetition.com:1337</code>. Connecting with a browser didn't
work, but <code>netcat</code> did:</p>
<pre><code>$ netcat satellite.ctfcompetition.com 1337

<p>Clearly, the password is the flag.</p>
