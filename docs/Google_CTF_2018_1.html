<p><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2018/05/google-ctf-2018-is-here.html">The third annual Google CTF</a>
took place on June 23, 2018. The quests are now available for everyone to try,
so let's go!</p>
<h2 id="letter">Letter</h2>
<p>This is the first beginner's quest and is extremely easy. The attached ZIP file
contains a PDF file, opening it shows a letter with username and password
blacked out. However, the text can be selected. Selecting and pasting
everything into an empty document reveals the password: <code>CTF{ICanReadDis}</code>.
And that is the flag.</p>
<h2 id="floppy">Floppy</h2>
<p>Like before, the attachment is a ZIP file, opening it with 7-Zip shows that it
contains just one file: <code>foo.ico</code>. However, double-clicking on <code>foo.ico</code> would
open it like a folder, which reveals 2 files: <code>driver.txt</code> and <code>www.com</code>.
Opening <code>driver.txt</code>, it shows:</p>
<pre><code>This is the driver for the Aluminum-Key Hardware password storage device.
     CTF{qeY80sU6Ktko8BJW}

In case of emergency, run www.com
</code></pre>
<p>And there is the flag. What's in <code>www.com</code>? Well, that needs to wait for
later.</p>
<h2 id="ocriscool">OCR is Cool</h2>
<p>This time, the ZIP attachment contains a PNG file, it is the screenshot of an
email, but the text is all gibberish. The quest prompt says:</p>
<pre><code>Caesar once said, don't stab me... [...]
</code></pre>
<p>Caesar?</p>
<pre><code>$ caesar
The program 'caesar' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
apt install bsdgames
$ sudo apt install bsdgames
[...]
$ man caesar
[...]
NAME
     caesar, rot13 — decrypt caesar ciphers

SYNOPSIS
     caesar [rotation]
[...]
</code></pre>
<p>Ah, caesar ciphers. It is a simple (and unsafe) encryption algorithm that
rotates the alphabet. Since the flag should look like <code>CTF{...}</code>, it doesn't
take long to spot a fishy string in the screenshot. The resolution of the image
is not great, so let's OCR it manually:</p>
<pre><code>VMY{vtxltkvbiaxkbltlnulmbmnmbhgvbiaxk}
</code></pre>
<p>The difference between <code>C</code> and <code>V</code> is 19, let's try it:</p>
<pre><code>$ caesar 19
VMY{vtxltkvbiaxkbltlnulmbmnmbhgvbiaxk}
OFR{omqemdoubtqduemegnefufgfuazoubtqd}
</code></pre>
<p>Hum, doesn't look right. Since we are trying to decrypt the cypher, it needs
to be rotated backward, but since there are 26 letters in the alphabet,
rotating forward <code>26 - 19 = 7</code> times should be equivalent as rotating backwards
19 times. Let's try it:</p>
<pre><code>$ caesar 7
VMY{vtxltkvbiaxkbltlnulmbmnmbhgvbiaxk}
CTF{caesarcipherisasubstitutioncipher}
</code></pre>
<p>And indeed, the flag is recovered.</p>

<p>Under construction… Come back later!</p>
<h2 id="floppy2">Floppy 2</h2>
<p>Under construction… Come back later!</p>
<h2 id="thatsitfornow">That's It for Now</h2>
<p>That's all for now. I will certainly look into other challenges later. In the
meantime, why don't you go try those challenges out yourself?</p></div>
