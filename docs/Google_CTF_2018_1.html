<p><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2018/05/google-ctf-2018-is-here.html">The third annual Google CTF</a>
took place on June 23, 2018. And the quests are now
available for everyone to try. The first few quests are very easy, so let's go!</p>
<h2 id="letter">Letter</h2>
<p>This is the first challenge and is extremely easy. The attached ZIP file
contains a PDF file, opening it shows a letter with username and password
blacked out. However, the text can be selected. Selecting and pasting
everything into an empty document reveals the password: <code>CTF{ICanReadDis}</code>.
And that is the flag.</p>
<h2 id="floppy">Floppy</h2>
<p>Like before, the attachment is a ZIP file, opening it with 7-Zip shows that it
contains just one file: <code>foo.ico</code>. However, double-clicking on <code>foo.ico</code> would
open it like a folder, and reveals 2 files: <code>driver.txt</code> and <code>www.com</code>. Opening
<code>driver.txt</code>, it shows:</p>
<pre><code>This is the driver for the Aluminum-Key Hardware password storage device.
     CTF{qeY80sU6Ktko8BJW}

In case of emergency, run www.com
</code></pre>
<p>And there is the flag.</p>
<h2 id="thatsitfornow">That's it for now</h2>
<p>That's all for now. I will certainly look into other challenges later. In the
meantime, why don't you go try those challenges out yourself?</p></div>
